    """
    An immutable set view.

    Derived from :class:`~py3:collections.abc.Set`.

    This class provides an immutable view on a possibly mutable set object.
    The set object must be an instance of :class:`~py3:collections.abc.Set`,
    e.g. :class:`set`, or a user-defined class.

    This can be used for example when a class maintains a set that should be
    made available to users of the class without allowing them to modify the
    set.

    In the description of this class, the term 'view' always refers to the
    :class:`SetView` object, and the term 'set' or 'underlying set' refers to
    the set object the view is based on.

    The :class:`SetView` class supports the complete behavior of Python class
    :class:`set`, except for any methods that would modify the set.
    Note that the non-modifying methods of class :class:`set` are a superset of
    the methods defined for the abstract class :class:`~py3:collections.abc.Set`
    (the methods are listed in the table at the top of the linked page).

    The view is "live": Since the view class delegates all operations to the
    underlying set, any modification of the underlying set object will be
    visible in the view object.

    Note that only the view object is immutable, not necessarily its items.
    So if the items in the underlying set are mutable objects, they can be
    modified through the view.

    Note that in Python, augmented assignment (e.g. ``x += y``) is not
    guaranteed to modify the left hand object in place, but can result in the
    left hand name being bound to a new object (like in ``x = x + y``).
    For details, see
    `object.__iadd__() <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iadd__>`_.

    For the SetView class, augmented assignment is supported and results in
    binding the left hand name to a new SetView object.
