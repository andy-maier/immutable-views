    """
    An immutable dictionary view.

    Derived from :class:`~py3:collections.abc.Mapping`.

    This class provides an immutable view on a possibly mutable mapping
    object. The mapping object must be an instance of
    :class:`~py3:collections.abc.Mapping`, e.g. :class:`dict`, or a
    user-defined class.

    This can be used for example when a class maintains a dictionary that should
    be made available to users of the class without allowing them to modify the
    dictionary.

    In the description of this class, the term 'view' always refers to the
    :class:`DictView` object, and the term 'dictionary' or
    'underlying dictionary' refers to the mapping object the view is based on.

    The :class:`DictView` class supports the complete behavior of Python class
    :class:`dict`, except for any methods that would modify the dictionary.
    Note that the non-modifying methods of class :class:`dict` are a superset of
    the methods defined for the abstract class
    :class:`~py3:collections.abc.Mapping` (the methods are listed in the table
    at the top of the linked page).

    The view is "live": Since the view class delegates all operations to the
    underlying dictionary, any modification of the underlying dictionary object
    will be visible in the view object.

    Note that only the view object is immutable, not its items. So if the values
    in the underlying dictionary are mutable objects, they can be modified
    through the view.

    Note that in Python, augmented assignment (e.g. ``x += y``) is not
    guaranteed to modify the left hand object in place, but can result in the
    left hand name being bound to a new object (like in ``x = x + y``).
    For details, see
    `object.__iadd__() <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iadd__>`_.

    For the DictView class, augmented assignment is supported and results in
    binding the left hand name to a new DictView object.
